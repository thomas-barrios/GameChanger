You are a very experienced developer with 30 years of experienced, your code is efficient, short and very readable, including comments and optimizations.

You have profound knowledge of DCS both as user and developer, that allows you to optimize hardware, software to the upper most limits.

You are constantly testing and optimizing your DCS setup, focusing on performance (lowest frame times) and stability (no stutters) to participate in virtual combat championships like TACT, SATAL, and training on servers link JustDogFights. Currently you are member of HARPIA a DCS competitive team with 3 global championships victories.

Recently you develop a way of backup of DCS configurations, by coping and storing specifc configuration folders and files.

Now you are thinking in go further.

Create a new application, with the following funcions:

DCS optimizer, or "Game Changer" (temporary name)

Config
- Log configuration 
	Monitor changes in settings of: DCS, VR Headset, Nvidia Control Panel, Windows SO, Olher softwares like PimaXR, and Quadviews Foveated.
- Compare
	Compare changes from one point in time to anoter, displaying what was changed.
- Performance
	Display changes in DCS performance preseting a corelation between config changes and performance.
- Backup changes
	Store files and folders containing settings preserved for future analysis or restoration.
- Restore
	Restoration od the system to prior states quick and easely.

Manage
- Keybinds
	Import backup Keybinds and 
- Presets
	Store and aplies config presets including not only DCS settings, but also preset settings for: VR Headsets, Graphic Cards, Nvida Control Panel, and SOs configs
- Skins
	Imports and exports skins online with easy, sharing them with other users

Ranking
- Performance
	Capture, anlyse and compare DCS performance across multiple users, hardware, and configs, allowing a broad view  of impact on performance and best praticies.
- Hardware
	Capture, anlyse and compare DCS performance across multiple hardwares like CPUs, GPUs, MOtherboards, Disks, and memories, allowing a broad view on hardware impact on performance and best praticies.
- Players
	Capture and compare players performance based on info gathered from gaming sessions, like logs, tacview, etc. Ranking them among other players

Software caracteristics
- inspiration: DCS Setup spreadsheet, CapFrameX, DCS-Keybinds-Manage, TacView
- not to be afiliated with eagle dynamics
- future expand to other games not only DCS
- free and open source
- easy of development
- to be developed initialy by a team of one person
- prototype only, no advanced features
- prioritize Config funcions for initial development
- to be monetized in the future: sponsorship, ads, hosting, expansion to other games.


Analyse this software development project, consider the following:
- what is the best archeteture to build?
- what should be the roadmap of development?
- what technical strategies could be implemented to prototype first, develop latter?
- is there any other softwares for inspiration?
- is ther any other competitor softwares?

Do not build any code, just analyse, ponderate and ask for feedback.

--DONE----------------------------------------------------------------
Nex step: create an .exe file
evaluate all code, the .exe file must attend the following premises:
- single .exe
- named game-changer.exe
- operated thru parameters like: 
	-execute:backup, or 
	--execute restore --backup-folder "D:\GameChanger\Backup\2025-10-21-16-54-17-Backup" or
	--schedulle:atlogon or
	--schedulle:dailly
do not change any code, just analyse, consider and ask for feedback

--DONE----------------------------------------------------------------
Next we will include a restore-this-backup.bat in when a backup is created

Evaluate all code, the and the following premises:
- consider what shuold be th restore-this-backup.bat file name. what is the best pratice?
- should be presented to user the restoration status after running a restoration

Do not change any code, just analyse, consider and ask for feedback.


--DONE----------------------------------------------------------------
Next we will merge config.txt and backup_files.txt in a single file

Evaluate all code, the and the following premises:
- consider what shuold be this file name. config.txt? config.cfg? options.txt? what is the best pratice?
- this file will receive all configurations and defaults
- we will shortly add windoes services that could be optmized in this file too
- keep the file lean, but readble, self explanatory by design

Do not change any code, just analyse, consider and ask for feedback.


--DONE----------------------------------------------------------------
Next we will inproove the way the bakcup / restoration messaging is presented to the user and logged

Evaluate all code, the and the following premises:
- message display includes full path from original and backuped or restored files, this is large and difficult to read
- a message lean with repetitive information sanitized should be presented, whitout removing the sense of message
- consider options to present the messages in multiple ways so i can decide
- tis standard will be used in all messaging in the project

Do not change any code, just analyse, consider and ask for feedback.





--DONE----------------------------------------------------------------
Next we will incorporate the windows services optimization functionality. The attached scripts disables selected services for a specific machine. We will incoporate similar function.

Evaluate all code, the .exe file must attend the following premises:

- services must be scanned on the machine
- curent service status should be presented to the user
- a sumary and a selection from OptionalToDisble must be presented to user
- no change prior user confirmation
- service state should be backuped at backup_folder prior to changes
- restoration of services to a specifi service state backup shoulde be like resotration of config files

Next we will add the folloing features

Evaluate all code, the and the following premises:

- if no command is provided, display --help message
- after backup show backup location
- add option to restore last backup restore --last
- add option to restore backup based on relative position 
	restore 1 (restore the last, same as --last)
	restore 2 (restore the 2nd newer backup... and so on 
- remove MaxBackups=10 feature
- remove feature CompressBackups=false
- change bakup.json file name to services_bakup.json
Evaluate all code, the and the following premises:
- backups should be saved at C:\Users\Thomas\Documents\GameChanger\Config-Backups
- Reports should be saved at C:\Users\Thomas\Documents\GameChanger\TimeStamp-<TypeOfReport>-Report.txt

Do not change any code, just analyse, consider and ask for feedback.


--DONE-------------------------------------------------------------
Evaluate all code, the and the following premises:

- include the feature to compare backups, all kings file, folder and services
- the comparison shuold be at the alteration level, what configs were altered or not
- the result shoud be presented as a txt report saved on disk at C:\Users\Thomas\Documents\GameChanger\TimeStamp-Config-Report.txt
- The report should present
- the changed settings between the last backups
- in the future, we will colect performance data from NVIDA Frameview or CapFrameX and compare with backups, so we can relate config changes and performance corelations, have this as an future objective.
- present report layout options so i can decide

Do not change any code, just analyse, consider and ask for feedback.

Evaluate the following demands:
- merge report format detailed/summary/performance into one only focusing on performance and utilizing current report logic
- update help messages
